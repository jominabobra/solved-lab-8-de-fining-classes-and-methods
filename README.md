Lab 8: De fining Classes and Methodsstatic &amp; Constructor Edition

AbstractYour task is to complete two problems from the textbook.

Create a class RoomOccupancy that can be used to record the number of people in the rooms of a building. The class has the attributes:&#xf; numberInRoom { the number of people in a room&#xf; totalNumber { the total number of people in all rooms as a staticvariable The class has the following methods:&#xf; addOneToRoom{ adds a person to the room and increases the value of totalNumber&#xf; removeOneFromRoom { removes a person from the room, ensuring that numberInRoom does not go below zero, and decreases the value of totalNumber as needed&#xf; getNumber {returns the number of people in the room&#xf; getTotal {a static method that returns the total number of peopleCreate a few RoomOccupancy classes and con rm they work.

2 Assignment 2Programming Project 10 from the textbook.Write a program that will record the votes for one of two candidates by using the class VoteRecorder, which you will design and create. VoteRecorder will have static variables to keep track of the total votes for candidates andinstance variables to keep track of the votes made by a single person.It will have the following attributes:&#xf; nameCandidatePresident1 { a static string that holds the name of the rst candidate for president&#xf; nameCandidatePresident2 { a static string that holds the name of the second candidate for president&#xf; nameCandidateVicePresident1 { a static string that holds the name of the rst candidate for vice president&#xf; nameCandidateVicePresident2 { a static string that holds the name of the second candidate for vice president&#xf; votesCandidatePresident1 { a static integer that holds the number of votes for the rst candidate for president&#xf; votesCandidatePresident2 { a static integer that holds the number of votes for the second candidate for president&#xf; votesCandidateVicePresident1 { a static integer that holds the number of votes for the rst candidate for vice president&#xf; votesCandidateVicePresident2 { a static integer that holds the number of votes for the second candidate for vice president&#xf; myVoteForPresident { an integer that holds the vote of a single in- dividual for president (0 for no choice, 1 for the rst candidate, and 2 for the second candidate)&#xf; myVoteForVicePresident { an integer that holds the vote of a single individual for vice president (0 for no choice, 1 for the rst candidate, and 2 for the second candidate)Continued on the next pageIn addition to appropriate constructors, VoteRecorder has the following methods:&#xf; setCandidatesPresident(String name1, String name2) { a static method that sets the names of the two candidates for president&#xf; setCandidatesVicePresident(String name1, String name2) { astatic method that sets the names of the two candidates for vice president&#xf; resetVotes {a static method that resets the vote counts to zero&#xf; getCurrentVotePresident {a static method that returns a string with the current total number of votes for both presidential candidates&#xf; getCurrentVoteVicePresident { a static method that returns a string with the current total number of votes for both vice presidential candidates&#xf; getAndConfirmVotes { a non-static method that gets an individuals votes, con rms them, and then records them&#xf; getAVote(String name1, String name2) { a private method that returns a vote choice for a single race from an individual (0 for no choice, 1 for the rst candidate, and 2 for the second candidate)&#xf; getVotes { a private method that returns a vote choice for president and vice president from an individual&#xf; confirmVotes { a private method that displays a persons vote for president and vice president, asks whether the voter is happy with these choices, and returns true or false according to a yes-or-no response&#xf; recordVotes { a private method that will add an individuals votes to the appropriate static variables
